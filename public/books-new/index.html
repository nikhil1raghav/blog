<p>Here are my thoughts on the books I&rsquo;ve read recently. I try to keep my reviews honest and concise, focusing on what made each book memorable or forgettable. The ratings are based on my personal enjoyment and the book&rsquo;s impact on me.</p>
<p><strong>Rating Scale:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>⭐ = Poor (1 star)</li>
<li>⭐⭐ = Below Average (2 stars)</li>
<li>⭐⭐⭐ = Average (3 stars)</li>
<li>⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Good (4 stars)</li>
<li>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Excellent (5 stars)</li>

{ title = &ldquo;Thoughts of a philosophical fighter pilot&rdquo;, review = &ldquo;I was bored when I read it for the first time. As it is a collection of his talks, material is very redundant.&rdquo;, rating = &ldquo;2&rdquo; },
{ title = &ldquo;The Castle - Franz Kafka&rdquo;, review = &ldquo;Frustrating. Last Kafka book I&rsquo;ll read&rdquo;, rating = &ldquo;2&rdquo; },
{ title = &ldquo;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&rdquo;, review = &ldquo;Ali Sethi sang this Ghazal &quot;Dil lagaane ki baat karte ho&quot; which is in the movie of the same name.

{ title = &ldquo;Lifecycle of Software Objects&rdquo;, review = &ldquo;Cool book cover. This can be a Netflix show. Resonates as you might have seen this pattern over and over in your life. A startup pioneers new tech, everything goes well until they run out of time to figure out how to make the business profitable. Now when they pull the plug and shut down the shop, hobbyists, tinkerers and fanboys are left behind. Finding ways to make whatever they&rsquo;re left with work. Forming communities.

{ title = &ldquo;Project Hail Mary&rdquo;, review = &ldquo;Book you can recommend to someone who wants to get into reading or sci-fi. Andy Weir writes like a blogger.

{ title = &ldquo;Brave New World&rdquo;, review = &ldquo;At this point things misinformation, short attention span, constant search for escapism, racism is so normalised that it doesn&rsquo;t ring any bells when you read about it in a ninety year old book. Watch Logan&rsquo;s run&rdquo;, rating = &ldquo;3&rdquo; },
