<p>Hi! it is first issue of this newsletter, sorry if it comes out to be a bit unpolished. Idea is to share links to things that I’ve explored myself and have helped me.</p>
<h2 id="tools"><strong>Tools</strong></h2>
<h4 id="resilio-syncsyncthing"><a href="https://www.resilio.com/individuals/">Resilio Sync</a> / <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a></h4>
<p>This week I discovered <a href="https://www.resilio.com/individuals/">Resilio Sync</a> which is a tool to sync files across devices, it uses bittorrent to sync files, so no middleman except peers (which should be your devices). I wanted a cheaper solution to sync my <a href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian</a> notes with phone.</p>
<p>There is an open-source solution too called <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> that does the same thing. I found resilio is easier to setup.</p>
<h3 id="tuxi"><a href="https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi">Tuxi</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes when you are in middle of something and have to do a quick google search and don’t have a web browser open (opening a web browser takes time). <a href="https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi">Tuxi</a> is a cli tool to do quick google searches in terminal and gives a concise answer if there exists one.</p>
<h2 id="resources"><strong>Resources</strong></h2>
<h4 id="codevault"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeVault">CodeVault</a></strong></h4>
<p>If you’re planning to learn about unix processes or want a practical introduction to system programming. Videos on this channel are really great. I don’t know about other playlists on this channel.</p>
<h4 id="roppers-academy-networking-roadmap"><a href="https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/training/networking">Roppers Academy Networking roadmap</a></h4>
<p>Currently I’m working my way through <a href="https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/training/networking">this</a> very specific roadmap on computer networks. This website has other learning paths which are good for fundamentals.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I’m reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84699.Never_Eat_Alone">Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazi</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613671-economics">Economics: The User’s guide by Ha-Joon Chang</a></p>
<p>Economics: The User’s guide is a great book, it is not structured as a guide or textbook. I liked the second chapter most which is history of capitalism and it does a good job connecting all the dots in your mind. Important events that you may have vague idea of from whatever history you still remember and their effect on global economics.</p>
<p>Never Eat alone is about networking, building meaningful business relationships. I find it quite overwhelming and bit uncomfortable at times though, as I don’t want managing/leveraging relationships to be a full time job. Still there are many nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there.</p>
