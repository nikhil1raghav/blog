<p>I&rsquo;ve seen youtubers add such lists in their description, tools they use for content creation, camera, lens, lights, even the keyboard they use.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to write mine and get to know what you use. I&rsquo;m a Software Engineer by profession, most of the tools I use can be used in any sort of knowledge work.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Obsidian</strong> - For notes or jotting anything under the sun. This is where everything ends up. I&rsquo;m using it since 2020. I have tried other note taking tools logseq, notion, joplin, simplenote and friends - paid, free and opensource but couldn&rsquo;t use them as simply I use obsidian.<br><br>It has most of what I&rsquo;ve learned in life since using it. All the books, journal entries, thoughts, drafts etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Raindrop.io</strong> - For bookmarks, web page archiving and research papers.I read a lot, I&rsquo;m a frequent HN, lobste.rs lurker and I come across at least 5 blogs a day that are interesting enough to read.<br><br>Raindrop gives me peace of mind that I don&rsquo;t have to keep tabs open, everything that I&rsquo;ve to read is at one place. I read the blogs&rsquo; permanent copy in raindrop and all highlights are automatically written to obsidian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perplexity</strong> - There is an AI mode in Google but once you use perplexity for complex queries there is no going back. I don&rsquo;t have to resort back to query like a toddler and break my query into words &ldquo;<em><strong>mount ntfs-3g mac</strong></em>&rdquo;, I can write &ldquo;<em><strong>find tools/libraries that can help a mac write to ntfs, prioritize open source, free to use tools</strong></em>&rdquo;. Nifty. I use it heavily, default search engine, now.<br><br>Before this how could you &ldquo;Find new blogging tools similar to hugo that have come up in recent years, what are their merits&rdquo;. You get the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>O&rsquo;reilly</strong> - Subscription for all the tech books, courses by oreilly and some other publishers in the domain like Manning, Packt, No starch. It is convenient and they have live sessions now and then. It was free at Flipkart, I bought mine when I left Flipkart for Uber, it is that good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Keep</strong> - For braindumping. Any screenshot, quick idea, thoughts go into Keep as it is always available on every device I use. Later on I move things to obsidian or archive them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Todoist</strong> - For tasks. But I barely use it now as I end up writing things on Post-it notes the night before or in the morning and doing them. Todoist or any task tracking app is still good for keeping lists. But I realised I don&rsquo;t use it that much.<br><br>I&rsquo;ll cancel my subscription and move my list to Google Tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blip</strong> - To share files across devices. It&rsquo;s like airdrop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zed</strong> - Editor of choice for personal projects. At work I use cursor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MarkText</strong> - To write blogs, posts etc. It has a minimal UI. I set Literata as default font and enjoy writing on it. Ideas just flow, it is like writing using pen and paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LM studio</strong> - Mostly with gpt-oss 20B or to play around with smaller fine tuned models. I don&rsquo;t pay for cursor, claude on personal computer, but I&rsquo;m lazy when it comes to scripts, this model does a decent job. I use it with Zed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notebook LM</strong> - I use it as Youtube summarizer. Ask questions about codebase and mindmaps on some long blog posts. Again any notes here go to obsidian.</p>
</li>
</ol>
