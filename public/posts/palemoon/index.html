<p><em>UPD : These views are really old, I still use firefox, you can stop updating firefox by making changes to about:policies or can use icecat or librewolf. But firefox is by far the most advanced and private browser.</em></p>
<p>I love minimal software and always try to minimize bloat on whatever system I use. I also like to read too many blogs on internet but you don&rsquo;t need a power hungry and feature rich browser to &ldquo;just read blogs&rdquo;. So recently, I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBWy1d-JE6A">this</a> video introducing <a href="https://hacktivis.me/projects/badwolf">BadWolf</a>, which is a minimal <a href="https://webkitgtk.org">WebKitGTK+</a> based browser that has two very accessible buttons to toggle javascript and images on a webpage and one simple download manager. I know there is much more going on behind the scenes, but this is what that meets the eye first.</p>
<p>BadWolf is an amazing option to read blogs without unnecessary power and memory usage. Then I visited <a href="https://hacktivis.me/projects/badwolf">BadWolf&rsquo;s home page</a>, it mentioned some blogs and <a href="https://digdeeper.neocities.org/ghost/mozilla.html">this</a> caught my eye. Don&rsquo;t forget to read it yourself. After reading it I checked myself and found that I don&rsquo;t have any control over how firefox updates itself. There used to be a choice earlier but now it&rsquo;s gone. I&rsquo;ve always used firefox as a daily driver and never noticed that it has changed a lot over time. So I replaced firefox with <a href="https://www.palemoon.org">Palemoon</a> and it is an amazing browser and also allows you to choose what updates to install. If you&rsquo;re a firefox user you&rsquo;ll find yourself at home with Palemoon, all keybindings are same, you can create profiles of your browser just like firefox and all <code>about: </code> addresses work except <code>about:preferences</code>. I&rsquo;ve used it for two days and here are some good and not so bad things about Palemoon.</p>
<h1 id="pros">Pros</h1>
<ul>
<li>Native RSS feed viewer.</li>
<li>You can add RSS feed from address bar if a website has one.</li>
<li>Automatically adds search engines you visit no need to add and remove a search bar like firefox whenever you want to add a custom search engine.</li>
<li>Full blown firefox alternative barring some features (which will be discussed in cons).</li>
<li>Support for firefox extensions (*.xpi).</li>
<li>Browsing history and bookmark section is better organized and easier to find.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cons">Cons</h1>
<ul>
<li>No WebRTC support.</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t support all extensions from firefox specifically <strong>web extensions</strong>.</li>
<li>In firefox there is a padlock in address bar which is really accessible option to clear cookies and site data. In palemoon you need to do it in old fashioned way by opening page info <code>Ctrl + I</code> .</li>
<li>On some websites experience is not smooth as it is on firefox. For example <a href="https://competitiveprogramming.info">competitiveprogramming.info</a> lags on palemoon, but runs smoothly on firefox.</li>
</ul>
<p>After installing Palemoon I configured all profiles as I had in firefox and  thought Palemoon is a solid replacement for Firefox and it is time to say goodbye to Firefox. But then I tried to open Google Classroom and wasn&rsquo;t able to join any meeting. Then I found out that Palemoon doesn&rsquo;t support <a href="https://webrtc.org">WebRTC</a> for some security and privacy reasons. After all I can&rsquo;t uninstall firefox that easily as I need to take my classes. So here I am with two more browsers installed and waiting for this lockdown to end so that I can uninstall firefox for good.</p>
