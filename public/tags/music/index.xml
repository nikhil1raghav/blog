      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD&#34;&gt;MPD&lt;/a&gt; is a server-side music player, which can be further improved by using different plugins and libraries to enhance overall music listening experience on all the devices on a network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it is a server-side application you&amp;rsquo;ll also need a client to go along with it, usually MPD can relay its output to different channels at the same time so you can enjoy it on anything that can process a http stream and is on the same network (any device with a web browser).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
