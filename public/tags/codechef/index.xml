      <description>&lt;p&gt;Made 3 full successful submissions and 1 partial scored 325 points with lot of wrong submissions and ended up at 230th place. Here are the notes on some problems I solved during and after the contest and the thought process I had while solving them. I write these posts so that I can document any new problem solving techniques, observation or method of thinking about the problem I encounter during a contest. It also doubles up as an upsolving journal and lets me review my own thought process and outlook during the contest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
