Happy new year!  
Here is the first edition for this year, here are some links worth your time.  

  
1. [Neural network from scratch](https://sirupsen.com/napkin/neural-net) is a surprisingly short and thorough blog post on building a neural net from scratch to understand how they work. Don’t forget to checkout other posts on this blog. There are some really cool deep dives.

2. If you ever wanted to learn about how video infrastructure on internet works. [How video works](https://howvideo.works/) is a primer on playback, content-delivery and transcoding, all on one page.

3. DRM is an integral part of content delivery on internet, it stops end user from making unauthorized copies of the content. If you want to learn how DRM works then try reading [DRM is not a black box](https://sander.saares.eu/categories/drm-is-not-a-black-box/), a 4 part blog series by [Sander Saares](https://sander.saares.eu/) who is an expert in video streaming tech.

4. There are [too](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) [many](https://github.com/agarcialeon/awesome-database) [bloated](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses#readme) “awesome” lists on internet which curate resources for learning any tech under the sun, having too many links exacerbates the problem by inducing a dilemma in what is best and sometimes creates a FOMO.  
[Teach yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) is an awesome list (literally) which recommends only one book and one youtube playlist or course for core topics in computer science.

_EDIT : Two more links that should have been in this edition_

5. [How to trade money and time](https://meteuphoric.com/2014/03/25/how-to-trade-money-and-time/) is about how surprisingly often we end up worse off after wasting time in finding bargains.

6. [The third web](https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/) , long explainer on what comprises web3 and authors view on it in second half.
