Hi! it is first issue of this newsletter, sorry if it comes out to be a bit unpolished. Idea is to share links to things that I’ve explored myself and have helped me.

## **Tools**

#### [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) / [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)

This week I discovered [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) which is a tool to sync files across devices, it uses bittorrent to sync files, so no middleman except peers (which should be your devices). I wanted a cheaper solution to sync my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes with phone.  
  
There is an open-source solution too called [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) that does the same thing. I found resilio is easier to setup.

### [Tuxi](https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi)

Sometimes when you are in middle of something and have to do a quick google search and don’t have a web browser open (opening a web browser takes time). [Tuxi](https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi) is a cli tool to do quick google searches in terminal and gives a concise answer if there exists one.

## **Resources**

#### **[CodeVault](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeVault)**

If you’re planning to learn about unix processes or want a practical introduction to system programming. Videos on this channel are really great. I don’t know about other playlists on this channel.

#### [Roppers Academy Networking roadmap](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/training/networking)

Currently I’m working my way through [this](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/training/networking) very specific roadmap on computer networks. This website has other learning paths which are good for fundamentals.  

## Books

I’m reading [Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84699.Never_Eat_Alone) and [Economics: The User’s guide by Ha-Joon Chang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613671-economics)  
  
Economics: The User’s guide is a great book, it is not structured as a guide or textbook. I liked the second chapter most which is history of capitalism and it does a good job connecting all the dots in your mind. Important events that you may have vague idea of from whatever history you still remember and their effect on global economics.

Never Eat alone is about networking, building meaningful business relationships. I find it quite overwhelming and bit uncomfortable at times though, as I don’t want managing/leveraging relationships to be a full time job. Still there are many nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there.
