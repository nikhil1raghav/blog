I had this idea of writing posts about whatever new algorithms I learn and the problems I solve so that it can be used as a collection of resources and a starting point for anyone who wants to learn the same. So in such blogs I'll point to the resources I used (I'm not re-inventing the wheel), these resources have links to other resources so I won't list them, then I'll list some problems that I solved and write some ideas under each problem.
