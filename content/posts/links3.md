- [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org) Purely text-based approach to recording terminal sessions. I saw something of this kind on [scrimba](https://scrimba.com) where you can pause the video and start editing the code on the screen. Asciinema is a better way to post command line sessions or tutorials than writing down zillion commands for copy pasting or a gif without any video controls where someone has to wait for the loop to complete so that they can pickup from where they left.
