Hi, I'm Nikhil.  Welcome to my website. 


I like [singing](https://www.instagram.com/raghav.nikhil_/), [reading](/books), photography and staying fit.


I love art in every form, movies, album cover, grafitti on top of a matchbox or jingle in a toothpaste ad.

I'm happiest when I'm solving complex problems with people who are kind, thoughtful and love to learn from each other. Working as an engineer at Uber, before that I worked at Flipkart.

I'm a solid type [A-person](https://www.b-society.org/chronobiology/).


Long time back, I created [kindle-send](https://github.com/nikhil1raghav/kindle-send). It allows you to send webpages, collection of bookmarks as an ebook to your ereader. Try this, if you read a lot of blogs and don't like to strain your eyes on a digital screen. BONUS - this way you can import highlights to obsidian, readwise etc.


[Purple Terminal Newsletter](https://purpleterminal.substack.com) - Here I share links to blogs and tools I find interesting.
