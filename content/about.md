Hi, I'm Nikhil.  Welcome to my website. 


I like singing, basketball, reading all kind of books (except softcore self-help), graphic designing (almost created a new logo for codeforces) , creating tools to remove toil from my workflow, and watching movies.

[Purple Terminal Newsletter](https://purpleterminal.substack.com) - Here I share links to blogs and tools I find interesting.
