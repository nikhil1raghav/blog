Hi, I'm Nikhil.  Welcome to my website. 


Right now I work as Software Engineer @ [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com) on central build & delivery system. 


Apart from work I like solving puzzles, singing, reading all kind of books (except softcore self-help), graphic designing (almost created a new logo for codeforces) , creating tools to remove toil from my workflow, and watching good old movies.
