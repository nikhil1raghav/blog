Hi, I'm Nikhil.  Welcome to my website. 


I love to sing (sometimes I spend hours jamming), play basketball, reading, collecting music (to listen to music in outer space), designing banners, logos and vector art (don't do it anymore). 

I'm a sucker for good visual design and typography. Trying to learn 3D modelling just because I love what [beeplecrap](https://www.behance.net/beeple) does.

I watch a lot of movies too, if that passes as a hobby.

I'm happiest when I'm solving complex problems with people who are kind, thoughtful and love to learn from each other.

I'm a solid type [A-person](https://www.b-society.org/chronobiology/). Slowly turning into B ;).



Long time back, I created [kindle-send](https://github.com/nikhil1raghav/kindle-send). It allows you to send webpages, collection of bookmarks as an ebook to your ereader. Try this, if you read a lot of blogs and don't like to strain your eyes on a digital screen. BONUS - this way you can import highlights to obsidian, readwise etc. 





[Purple Terminal Newsletter](https://purpleterminal.substack.com) - Here I share links to blogs and tools I find interesting.
