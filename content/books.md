## [The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project)

- Interesting read, way better than teaching all the managerial maxims in a non-fictional manner. Didn't know that CI and 10 deployments a day is not the norm everywhere and how much amount of work it takes to get there. Still characters are predictable sometimes and more of caricatures of the role they're in which somehow helps the narration.

## [Pirate Cinema](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539171-pirate-cinema?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Wh0QyJzQVm&rank=1)

- A great take on piracy and its implications and the concept of intellectual property. Covers the real-life conflict between megacorps and people over content and culture respectively. From what I've read everywhere it is not the best work of author but it felt very good and new to read and tastes are subjective. Loved the way how lively and life-like Cecil and his friends are. Not so predictable David v/s Goliath story. Laws can be more stringent in today's scenario as theaters aren't operating at full capacity and big money is poured into streaming platforms which are more prone to piracy than theaters.

## [Swipe to unlock](https://swipetounlock.com)

- Liked the way TCP/IP was explained. Book is written with the intention of being accessible. Not that illuminating for your daily hackernews visitor, but it is good as an introductory book for anyone who wants to make sense of what is going on in the tech world.

## [1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=FwDAxLt8Eu&rank=1)

All the time while reading it I was drawing parallels between 1984 in the book and today, how telescreens, manufacturing consent through media and surveillance is mainstream today. The book mainly intended as a warning written in 1949 works as a manual in 2020. There are couple of movies based on the book but none matches the cruelty and intensity of the book.

## [Food rules : An Eater's manual](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7015635-food-rules)

Took a detour from the dry and lengthy books I was reading, it is a short and very spaced out book filled with witty and nicely explained nuggets of food wisdom like "Don't eat what your grandma won't recognize as food" to "whiter the bread, sooner you'll be dead". No nutritional gobble-de-gook used, everything is stated as simply and coherently it can be.

## [The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy through the Maze of Computer Espionage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18154.The_Cuckoo_s_Egg)

Book is exactly what its title says. At the beginning I thought that the hacker is a warm-up and will be caught at the end of first 20 pages and main course is due after that but you can never imagine how that story spans through about 250 pages and none of it is filler. Loved how it takes you back to earlier time in computing when average computer user had more digital literacy than people have today (technology is so accessible). Above all the story is true and very engaging.
