## [The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project)

- Very practical ideas for managing the WIP (I didn't even know what it is before I read the book).

#### 4 kinds of work
1. Business projects
2. Internal projects
3. Changes
4. Unplanned work

> Read **The goal** by Eli Goldratt

#### 3 ways
- __Identify the constraint__
	- Bottleneck that dictates output of the entire system
- __Exploit the constraint__
	- Don't allow constraint to waste any time
- __Subordinate the constraint__



> Remember, outcomes are what matter not the process, not controls,or, for that matter, what work you complete.

> It almost doesn't matter what you improve, as long as you're improving something. Why, because if you aren't improving, entropy guarantees that you are actually getting worse.

## [Pirate Cinema](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539171-pirate-cinema?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Wh0QyJzQVm&rank=1)

- A great take on piracy and its implications and the concept of intellectual property as a whole

> Those companies own all our culture and they get to make anything they want with it. The rest of us have to break the law to do what they do all the time. But it's everyone's culture -- that's the whole point right? Once you put it out into the world, it's the *world's* -- it's part of the stories we tell one another to make sense of life.
